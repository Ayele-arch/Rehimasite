    A cosmetic is generally defined as “Any substance or preparation for human use for<br> the purpose of cleansing, beautifying or altering the appearance <br> to include personal toiletry products (such as shampoos and lotion), <br> products and fragrances.”
    Certain products (e.g., anti-dandruff shampoo) that are classified as cosmetics in<br> other countries (e.g., in the EU) may be regulated as Over-The-Counter (OTC)<br> drugs (in the USA) or therapeutic goods (in Australia) or <br> (in Japan) or non-prescription drugs (in Canada). <br> legislative requirements vary from country to country, <br> of the requirements can be generally grouped into the following categories:

    <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cosmetics Testing</li>
          <li>Home and Personal Care Product Services</li> 
          <li>NRegistration / Licensing / Notification  </li>
